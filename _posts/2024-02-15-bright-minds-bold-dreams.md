Looking back on my journey, I owe much to my mother and my extraordinary second-grade teacher, Mrs. Wiggins. They instilled in me a profound admiration for innovators like Garrett Morgan, George Washington Carver, John Albert Burr, and more.

Now, as a parent, I'm on a mission to share this passion with my children and the next generation. I've decided to make the electronic versions of my book completely free and available for download here on my blog.

If you'd like a physical copy, once it's completed I'll place a link to where you can purchase it.

Here's a list of the 25 innovators that are included.
