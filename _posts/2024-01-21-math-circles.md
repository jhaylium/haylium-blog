### Why I'm Reading this Book
I remember loving math as a child and then one day that changed.
I think that there's something that we're doing to drum the
fascination out of children, and I'm hoping to prevent that from
occurring with my kids. I heard about this book on Reddit called
<i>Math from Three to Seven: The Story of a Mathematical Circle for Preschoolers</i>.

This page will serve as my notes on this book.

#### What is a math circle?
Groups of people get together to discuss and explore math.
It's popular in Eastern Europe and has been growing in the
United States. The University of Floria has a [Math circle](https://circle.math.ufl.edu/)
that I may end up checking out when the boys are older.

They typically focus on problems instead of exercises like our
schools typically do. These are conducted outside the school
system and last well until adulthood.

#### Exercise
The tactics used to solve a particular calculation such as 
formulas

#### Problems
A question to which you don't they know the answer


### Advice From The Intro of The Book
1. Have fun! Of course, if it’s not enjoyable, kids will be turned off; this
is just common sense. But it’s deeper than that: humor relieves stress,
builds community, enhances confidence. Zvonkin gives many examples
that show how laughter saves the day.
2. Prepare carefully, even though things never turn out the way you
planned. Zvonkin sometimes criticizes his lack of preparation, and of-
ten thinks things up on the spot, but a remarkable feature of his circle
was the loving attention that he (and his wife, Alla) gave to conceiving
and creating a multitude of cards, pictures, games, etc. The serendip-
itous moments, of which there are many, some quite successful, do not
happen in a vacuum; they are nourished by hours of prior thininking
and working.
3. Recognize the individuality of each child. Another common-sense idea,
but one that is easy to forget. Not only is every kid different, but they
change from minute to minute. Zvonkin is a harsh judge of himself,
frequently confessing to impatience and insensitivity. But in fact, this
introspective self-criticism is what keeps him connected with his kids.
It is only the teachers who worry about their insensitivity who have
a chance to actually listen to their students. And indeed, this book
is nothing if not a detailed record of listening, observing, and mind-
reading.
4.  Use physical objects (“manipulatives”) whenever possible, engaging chil-
dren with the “real” world. Little kids don’t learn by listening to lec-
tures. They have to touch, move, count, cut, glue, draw, etc. This is
especially important in our modern computer-dominated age. Zvonkin
tells a poignant story, “You can touch it!” (p. 237) about kids in a
computer lab who’d rather play with an antique calculator that has
a handle that turns. Throughout the book, we learn that people, not
just young children, do not think in a vacuum; part of what makes us
human is our connection to the physical world. Teachers who ignore
this do so at their peril.

5.  Don’t explain much. Let them figure it out. Any teacher or parent
knows that this is easier said than done, and Zvonkin relates many
examples of his own struggles to let his kids flounder and grapple with
difficulties, and the joy he feels when kids tackle hard questions that
they raise themselves.
6. Be flexible, including when interpreting the above rules. A recurrent
theme in the book is the danger of rigidity. Zvonkin discovers that his
best sessions are the well-prepared, yet serendipitous ones; where he
tries something that he invested a lot of planning in, but it doesn’t go as
planned, so he changes gears. Conversely, some of his worst experiences
happen when he sticks to his guns, against his better judgement.
