Hey there and welcome to my blog. This is a place where I'll be keeping my notes, showcasing my failures, and celebrating my wins. It's just a general blog for my own purposes, I've been wanting to write more so here I go. 

# About me
As of 10-29-2021, when I finally decided to write this post, I work as a Software Engineering Senior Manager for an insurance company. None of my writing on this blog is in anyway intended tied to this company and all views and content posted here are my own. I love coding and have been doing it without interuption since about 2014. My love of computing started when I was a child. I was lucky that the elementary school that I went to had computers in every classroom. 

In my off-time I work on my own projects which span a number of different areas, I'm currently studying for the Finra Series 65 exam, working, and I can't stress how little I am, on an autonomous cooler, and work on a number of web and NLP projects. 

# My Content
It's my blog so I'm going to write about whatever I feel like. It'll mostly be programming, robotics, and finance as that's what interests me. If you're reading this, thanks for stopping by and giving this a look.
